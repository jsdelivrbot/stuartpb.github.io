A while back after visiting the Retrofit store on Capitol Hill in Seattle and
listening to Time Zone at home, I just had this funny visual flash through my
head of combining the two, so I threw together a quick page to see what it
would look like. For lack of a better place to put it, I uploaded it to my
Github user space. This page was the old location for it, before I decided to
re-organize my Github space so that sort of thing was in its own directory.

you're ready for sound, and give it a few seconds.
